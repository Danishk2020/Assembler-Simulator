Custom Assembler and Simulator for 16-bit ISA

This repository contains a Python-based custom assembler and simulator for a 16-bit Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) developed as part of a Computer Organization assignment. The assembler and simulator translate and execute low-level assembly instructions according to a defined ISA, handling various operations such as arithmetic, memory access, and control flow.

Project Structure

assembler.py: This script contains the implementation of the assembler, which converts assembly language instructions into binary machine code based on the custom ISA.
simulator.py: This script simulates the execution of binary machine code generated by the assembler, following the ISA's specifications.
Features

Assembler:
Converts assembly instructions to binary machine code.
Handles six encoding types (Type A, B, C, D, E, and F) and various instructions including arithmetic, logic, memory, and control operations.
Performs syntax checks and error handling for:
Undefined labels and variables
Misuse of registers and immediate values
Missing or mispositioned halt instructions (hlt).
Generates distinct error messages when syntax errors are detected.
Simulator:
Loads binary instructions generated by the assembler into memory.
Simulates instruction execution, updating the Program Counter (PC), registers, and flags as specified by the ISA.
Outputs the program counter and register states after each instruction execution, and finally dumps the memory state.
Usage

Running the Assembler
The assembler reads from standard input and outputs either the binary code or error messages.

bash
Copy code
python assembler.py < input.asm > output.bin
Input: Assembly code file containing assembly instructions.
Output: A binary file containing machine code or error messages if syntax errors are present.
Running the Simulator
The simulator reads binary machine code and outputs the program counter and register states after each instruction.

bash
Copy code
python simulator.py < output.bin
Output: Prints the program counter, register state, and final memory dump after program execution.
Example

Given an assembly program (example.asm):

asm
Copy code
var X
mov R1 $10
mov R2 $100
mul R3 R1 R2
st R3 X
hlt
Run the assembler:
bash
Copy code
python assembler.py < example.asm > example.bin
Run the simulator:
bash
Copy code
python simulator.py < example.bin
ISA Specifications

16-bit ISA with 6 encoding types and a range of arithmetic, memory, and control instructions.
Supports a variety of registers (R0â€“R6 and FLAGS) and handles 8-bit memory addresses for double-byte addressable memory (512 bytes total).
Detailed ISA structure, including instruction types and binary encoding, is available in the project documentation.
Testing

Test cases are provided to validate the assembler and simulator functionalities. Ensure all test cases pass to confirm compliance with the ISA.

This README provides an overview and instructions for using the assembler and simulator for your custom ISA.
